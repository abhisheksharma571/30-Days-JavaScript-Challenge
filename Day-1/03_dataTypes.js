//Task 4: create variables of different data types( number, string, boolean, object, array) and log each variable's type using typeof operator.
let num = 10;     //Number
let str = "Hello";  //String
let bool = true;    //Boolean
let obj = {         //Object
    name: "John",
    age: 30
};
let arr = [1, 2, 3];    //Array
console.log(`num is: ${num} and its type is: ${typeof num}`);
console.log(`str is: ${str} and its type is: ${typeof str}`);
console.log(`bool is: ${bool} and its type is: ${typeof bool}`);
console.log(`obj is: ${obj} and its type is: ${typeof obj}`);
console.log(`arr is: ${arr} and its type is: ${typeof arr}`);
