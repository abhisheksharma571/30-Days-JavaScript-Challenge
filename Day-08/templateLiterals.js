//Task 1: use a template literals to create a string that includes variables for a person's name and age, and log the string to the console.

let name = "John";
let age = 30;
console.log(`My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`)

//The template literal is enclosed in backticks (`) and includes the variables within ${} to embed their values directly into the string.

//Task 2: Create a multi-line string using template literals and log it to the console.

let multiLineString = `This is a multi-line string.
You can write text on multiple lines
without needing any special characters.

This makes it easy to include formatted text
and maintain readability in your code.`;

console.log(multiLineString);
